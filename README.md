# Portfolio
A Portfolio of my work.

Inventory Management System: 
  The files in this folder I files I worked on during my time with Prosper IT Consulting.  In the calculation.cs file, I have commented     out all code that I did not write, but was done by the time I came onto the project.  The update.cshtml is a view that I created.
 
Calulator:
  This is a simple calculator I created in javascript.  This was an exercise in logic and javascript.
  
 Artist Portfolio Site:
  This is a project I created for a client.  I decided to use html, css, and javascript exclusivley to insure that I had a good grasp on      the basics.  I worked closely with the client, who drew up a design for the site, to insure the final product was exactly what she        wanted.    This porject  was a ton of fun.
